Deep Learning for Image Analysis @ AgroParisTech
===========================================

This repo hosts the tutorials on deep learning for image analysis organized at AgroParisTech as part of 
the IODAA master's program. It is under construction, and we expect some bugs and issues. 
Feel free to send feedback at romain dot thoreau at agroparistech dot fr.

You can look at the notebooks in a nicer format at https://dl4ia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

This repo, in its format, is inspired by the [UvA Deep Learning Tutorials](https://github.com/phlippe/uvadlc_notebooks/tree/master).
