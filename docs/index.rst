Deep Learning for Image Analysis @ AgroParisTech
===========================================

Welcome to the lectures and tutorials on deep learning for image analysis organized at AgroParisTech as part of 
the IODAA master's program! This page is under construction. It will host the lectures and tutorials given
in January 2026, following the schedule below. As this is the first time we present this course,
we expect some errors, bugs and issues. Please, send feedback at romain dot thoreau at agroparistech dot fr.

The tutorials are based on recent publications in top-tier scientific journals or conferences. 
They reproduce parts or variants of their numerical experiments.

Evaluation
----------

In groups of two, you will be randomly assigned one of the tutorial. You will have to complete the tutorial (in case you had not finished it 
during class), and reproduce another experiment of your choice from the original paper. You will be evaluated on the quality of the code,
the presentation of your experiments, and their interpretation.
